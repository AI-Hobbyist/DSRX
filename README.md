This is a refactored and enhanced version of _DiffSinger: Singing Voice Synthesis via Shallow Diffusion Mechanism_ based on the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02446) and [implementation](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger), which provides:

- Cleaner code structure: useless and redundant files are removed and the others are re-organized.
- Better sound quality: the sampling rate of synthesized audio are adapted to 44.1 kHz instead of the original 24 kHz.
- Higher fidelity: improved acoustic models and diffusion sampling acceleration algorithms are integrated.
- More controllability: introduced variance models and parameters for prediction and control of pitch, energy, breathiness, etc.
- Production compatibility: functionalities are designed to match the requirements of production deployment and the SVS communities.
